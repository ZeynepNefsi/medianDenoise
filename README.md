# Convolutional Neural Network with Median Layers for Denoising Salt-and-Pepper Contaminations

**This is a [Keras](https://keras.io/) version of Median Layer based CNN denoiser implemented by [Luming Liang](https://sites.google.com/site/lumingliangshomepage/) for removing salt-and-pepper noise**

### Dataset

**The training and validation datasets can be found in data directory, we use 91image as training set, all others as validation sets**
**The pretrained models can be found in pretrained directory **

### Training

Run train3 to start training a new faultSeg model by using the 200 synthetic datasets
